App Description
The function and purpose of this app is that you can add a game’s title, a description about the game and attach an image that may be relevant to the game in question. When created a card is added the main screen, these game cards can be edited or totally deleted if wanted to

Motivation for App Idea
It seemed easy to base the app on something I was interested in as that would allow me to know what to put into the app ideally as nothing similar on the play store seemed to exist for the app. So I thought it would be handy to have such an app that exists on the Play Store.  Plus, I had to make it simple enough to implement and create within the timeframe given without being too ambitious and getting burned because of it.

Roadmap
If I were to add more to the app after the final upload, next on the list would be a spinner style box with a list of pre set choices to allow the user to choose what system the game they had picked was available on. Next would be an implementation for the gallery side of the app to correctly show the images used for all the games on their own to view them at your leisure.
After that there would be plans to add a confirmation box during the deletion process in case the user pressed the delete button by accident to lower the risk of accidental deletions of game info cards.

User Experience
The user’s experiences were considered as it had to have ease of use and everything should clear and easy to understand. The colour scheme and text layout were made as to try and not cause eye strain to the users by using simple duller-toned colours as the menu bars and button backgrounds in addition to the white of the menu font used. The size and width of said buttons was also taken into consideration for ease of use.
