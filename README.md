Uses a API called picasso to load an image gallery that doesn't particularly work

Motivation for App Idea
It seemed easy to base the app on something I was interested in as that would allow me to know what to put into the app ideally as nothing similar on the play store seemed to exist for the app. Plus I had to make it simple enough to implement and create within the timeframe given without being too ambitious and getting burned because of it.

On the GitHub you can view what I added to the app via commits when they were ready to be added.

Roadmap
If I were to add more to the app after the final upload, next on the list would be a spinner style box with a list of pre set choices to allow the user to choose what system the game they had picked was available on. Next would be an implementation for the gallery side of the app to correctly show the images used for all the games on their own to view them at your leisure.
